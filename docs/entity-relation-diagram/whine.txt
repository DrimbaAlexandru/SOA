Gripes:
    We need an app level user, which then has one or more roles in each conference
        Those roles can be: 
            Chair member
            Author 
            Speaker
            Reviewer
            Listener
    In which entity are we to store the conference webpage URL?
	We don't.
    Please comment the possible values of each enum. It eases implementation a lot
	Solved.
    Where do we store presentation metadata?
	Solved.
    What about the presentations themselves?
	Solved.
    How are we implementing uploaded file versioning?
	Sort by upload date, latest is the good one.
    How do we store scheduling metadata for each session?
	Solved.
    Also, how do we store which papers are presented at which sections?
	Solved.
    We need to add a isPcMember flag for the User. I advise moving the flags to a separate table and form a many-to-many relationship between it and the user. It should ease further application extensions.
